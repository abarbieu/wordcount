# wordcount: an easy and quick way to analyze word frequencies

```{r}
library("wordcount")
library("tidyverse")
```


## example data

We would like to see what activities are most popular for national park trails,
but the information is given as a column of list like strings, see below:

```{r}
trails <- read.csv(here::here("Data", "national_park_trails.csv"))

trails$activities
```

## using wordcount

wordcount is set up to deal with data like this, along with more

```{r}
trails$activities %>%
  wordcount()
```

wordcount also works on more sentence like data

```{r}
speech <- readLines(here::here("Data", "hamlet_speech.txt"))

speech %>%
  wordcount()
```

## additional functionality

Say we want to clean up this speech, say punctuation and common words

```{r}
speech %>%
  wordcount(n=15,)
```
